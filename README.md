# Controlling Contaminants in 16S rRNA Gene Sequencing Experiments

We recently performed a study to understand the impact of decreasing microbial biomass on 16S rRNA gene sequencing experiments and evaluate the current computational strategies to control for contaminants (preprint available here).

This repository contains the compiled R Markdown documents to reproduce the analysis presented in the manuscript, divided into 4 primary sections:

* [Introduction and evaluating contaminants](./Analysis/ControllingConatminants16S.Rmd)
* [Removing contaminant ASVs with decontam](./Analysis/ControllingConatminants16S_decontam.Rmd)
* [Removing contaminant ASVs with SourceTracker](./Analysis/ControllingConatminants16S_SourceTrackerPrep.Rmd)
* [Evaluating SourceTracker results](./Analysis/ControllingConatminants16S_SourceTracker.Rmd)

We hope that this will serve as a resource and tutorial for those wishing to use these computational approaches on their own data.
